# Project Summary
The AI PO Generator is a web application that simplifies the process of creating professional Purchase Orders (POs) for businesses. Utilizing AI technology, it allows users to input essential company and vendor details, automatically generating compliant and formatted POs. This tool significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy, making it a perfect fit for small to medium-sized businesses looking for a streamlined solution.

# Project Module Description
- **Hero Section**: Introduces the application with a clear value proposition and call-to-action.
- **Company Section**: Captures company details including name, GST, address, and contact information.
- **Vendor Section**: Collects vendor information similar to the company section.
- **Line Items Section**: Allows users to dynamically add, edit, and remove line items for the PO with automatic calculations for totals.
- **PO Preview**: Displays a live preview of the PO as users fill in details, including export and print capabilities. The layout features the company logo and "PURCHASE ORDER" text aligned horizontally. The table header background color has been updated to light blue (`#dbeafe`) for improved readability. The print/download functionality has been enhanced to ensure no blank pages are included.
